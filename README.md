# My Journey to Building an OS Kernel from Scratch

My goal is to create an operating system kernel from the ground up. This repository documents my step-by-step learning journey.

## Learning Roadmap

### 1️⃣ **C Programming**

- [ ] **The C Programming Language** (K&R)
- [ ] [learn-c.org](https://learn-c.org/) - Interactive tutorials

### 2️⃣ **Assembly Language**

- [ ] **Programming from the Ground Up** by Jonathan Bartlett
- [ ] [x86 Assembly Guide](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs216/guides/x86.html)
- [ ] [OSDev Wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page) - Essential reference material

### 3️⃣ **OS Development**

- [ ] **The Little Book About OS Development**
- [ ] **JamesM's Kernel Development Tutorials**

### 4️⃣ **Study Existing Kernels**

Clone and analyze these kernels to understand real implementations:

- [ ] [xv6-riscv](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv) - Educational Unix-like OS by MIT
- [ ] [linux-0.01](https://github.com/zavg/linux-0.01) - Original Linux kernel
- [ ] [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) - Modern Unix-like OS

### 5️⃣ **Video Resources**

- [ ] [Building an OS](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFjM7v6KGMpiH2G-kT781ByCNC_0pKpPN) by Nanobyte
- [ ] [Andreas Kling](https://www.youtube.com/@awesomekling) - SerenityOS creator (goal: understand what is he saying)
